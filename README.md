# Exceptions 

# Unterminated string literals
<Unterminated string literals results into SyntaxErrors, which one must go back on their code and fix on the get go.>

# Runtime exceptions/ValueError
<One of the ways to handle/fix a runtime exception/value error is through the use of the EXCEPT keyword.>

# NameError
<This is a kind/type of error that might appear when a user passes an argument that doesnt look like a number as an argument to integer to return a number. One might use an "else" keyword to solve this type of error. But also if you want to catch exceptions in python one can use the keyword PASS on handling the error further >

# Libraries
<They are files of code that other programmers have written and you can use them in your own program. It can be done through modules. A module is a library that have one or more fucntion/features built into it. The main purose of library or module is to encourage reusability of code. One can use these libraries through a keyword import.>

# from
<Is a keyword in python that allows you to import functions from a module but it allows a programer to be more specific than import alone. >
